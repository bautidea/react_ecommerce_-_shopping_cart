# E-commerce and Shopping Cart.

Project start, first things to resolve.
1. E-commerce:
- Show a list of products, API to obtain products (https://dummyjson.com/docs/products).
- Add a filter per category, and per price.

2. Shopping Cart:
- Add products to cart.
- Delete/remove products from cart.
- Modify products amount in cart.
- Sync changes between cart and product list.
- Save in LocalStorage the cart, so changes persist in page re-loading.
